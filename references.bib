	abstract = {Iron is essential for all known life due to its redox properties; however, these same properties can also lead to its toxicity in overload through the production of reactive oxygen species. Robust systemic and cellular control are required to maintain safe levels of iron, and the liver seems to be where this regulation is mainly located. Iron misregulation is implicated in many diseases, and as our understanding of iron metabolism improves, the list of iron-related disorders grows. Recent developments have resulted in greater knowledge of the fate of iron in the body and have led to a detailed map of its metabolism; however, a quantitative understanding at the systems level of how its components interact to produce tight regulation remains elusive. A mechanistic computational model of human liver iron metabolism, which includes the core regulatory components, is presented here. It was constructed based on known mechanisms of regulation and on their kinetic properties, obtained from several publications. The model was then quantitatively validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data, and it is able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. A time course simulation following an oral dose of iron was compared to a clinical time course study and the simulation was found to recreate the dynamics and time scale of the systems response to iron challenge. A disease state simulation of haemochromatosis was created by altering a single reaction parameter that mimics a human haemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutation. The simulation provides a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease. This model supports and supplements understanding of the role of the liver as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling, including simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design of experiments to improve further our knowledge of this system.},

	abstract = {In recent years, air pollution control has caused great concern. This paper focuses on the primary pollutant SO2 in the atmosphere for analysis and control. Two indicators are introduced, which are the concentration of SO2 in the emissions (PSO2) and the concentration of SO2 in the atmosphere (ASO2). If the ASO2 is higher than the certain threshold, then this shows that the air is polluted. According to the uncertainty of the air pollution control systems model, 𝐻∞ control theory for the air pollution control systems is used in this paper, which can change the PSO2 with the method of improving the level of pollution processing or decreasing the emissions, so that air pollution system can maintain robust stability and the indicators ASO2 are always operated within the desired target.},

	abstract = {This chapter focuses on the reaction rates and selectivity in catalyst pores; and discusses the physical picture of the pore structure, the mechanism of transport in catalyst pores, and physical factors determining reaction rates on porous catalysts. Small pores appear to have fundamentally different catalytic properties, due to the peculiar way in which transport into and out of the catalyst pellet affects the reactivity of the catalyst, through its control of the partial pressure of reactant in the inner pore recesses. A catalyst pore is essentially a microscopic flow reactor. As molecules flow into a pore (mainly by diffusion), reaction occurs due to collisions with the pore wall and the partial pressure of reactant decreases, just as in a bulk scale flow reactor. Thus, the partial pressure of a reactant is in general smaller in the inner recesses of a catalyst pellet than at the pellet surface, just as the partial pressure of a reactant is lower at the outlet end of a bulk reactor than it is at the inlet end. From this simple phenomenon a large number of interesting deductions are possible.},
