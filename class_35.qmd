## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 35 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for segregated flow reactor and early/late mixing
* Understand
    * segregated flow reactor models are inherently empirical
    * there are different ways of incorporating thermal effects into segregated flow reactor models
* Be able to
    * calculate the output molar flow rates and temperature from a given reactor using an early mixing segregated flow reactor model
