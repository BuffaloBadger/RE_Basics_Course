## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 3 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for differential ideal gas law
* Understand
    * the BSTR model assumptions
    * when a gas reacts in a BSTR, the differential form of the ideal gas law usually must be added to the design equations
* Be able to select and simplify the mole and energy balance equations needed for modeling a given BSTR
