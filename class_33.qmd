## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 33 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for fluid element, cumulative/differential age distribution function, tracer, step-change/impulse stimulus, stimulus response, cumulative age distribution function for a CSTR/PFR
* Understand
    * the stimulus is applied instantaneously at the reactor inlet
    * the response is measured at the reactor outlet as a function of time elapsed since the stimulus was applied
    * the cumulative age distribution function ranges from 0 at an age of 0 to 1 at an age of infinity
    * the measured cumulative age distribution function for a reactor matching the ideal CSTR/PFR cumulative age distribution function is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the reactor to be modleled as an ideal CSTR/PFR
* Be able to calculate the cumulative age distribution function *vs.* age using step-change stimulus response data
