## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 31 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for a thermally back-mixed PFR
* Understand
    * the reactor inlet temperature should always be one of the variables found by numerically solving the heat exchanger balance equations for a thermally back-mixed PFR
    * when the reactor inlet temperature is one of the variables found by numerically solving the heat exchanger balance equations for a thermally back-mixed PFR, the PFR design equations can be solved within the heat exchanger residuals function if necessary
