## Preparation Examples {.ch}

**REB, The Book, Example 2.6.2** A new reactor is being developed with the hope of generating ethylene by the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, reaction (1). Reactions (2) and (3) also take place at the operating conditions of 1 atm and 150 °C. The process starts with 90% ethane and 10% air (you may take air to contain 79% N~2~ and 21% O~2~) and ends with a 50% conversion of O~2~ and a selectivity of 3 C~2~H~4~/CO~2~. Calculate the final mole fraction of CO~2~.
