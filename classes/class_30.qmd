## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 30 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for series/parallel reactors, cascade, mixing point, splitting point, and heat exchanger
* Understand
    * as the number of CSTRs connected in series increases, the behavior of the system approaches that of a PFR
    * when there is no heating or cooling between them, two PFRs connected in series are equivalent to a single PFR with the same total volume
    * mixing streams with unequal conversions should be avoided
* Be able to
    * select and simplify the mole, energy, and momentum balance equations needed for modeling a system that consists of one or more reactors, splitting points, mixing points, and/or heat exchangers
    * solve sets of coupled ATEs and IVODEs numerically
