## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 5 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for ate-determining step and quasi-equilibrium
* Understand
    * when one step in a reaction mechanism is rate-determining, all other steps are quasi-equilibrated
* Be able to
    * liminate concentrations of reactive intermediates from mechanistic rate expressions using quasi-equilibrium expressions, when appropriate
