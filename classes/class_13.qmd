## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 13 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for stable/unstable steady-state
* Understand when a reactor is perturbed from a steady state it may return to that steady state, transition to different steady state, or go into sustained oscillations
* Be able to
    * identify unstable steady states, ignition points and extinction points using a plot of outlet versus feed temperature
    * determine the stability of a CSTR steady state by simulating the transient response to a small perturbation
