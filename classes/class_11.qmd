## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 11 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for steady-state multiplicity
* Understand
    * there may be more than one physically realizable solution of the steady-state CSTR design equations
    * numerical ATE solvers only find one solution of the ATEs
    * there is only one inlet CSTR temperature for each outlet temperature
* Be able to
    * determine whether multiple steady states are possible for a given CSTR
    * obtain solutions of the CSTR design equations for each steady state
