## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 3 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for enzyme, homogeneous/heterogeneous catalyst, catalytic site, and surface coverage
* Understand
    * when a mechanism involves charged reagents, enzymes, or catalysts, a catalyst/charge conservation must replace one of the Bodenstein steady state approximations because the Bodenstein steady state approximations are not mathematically independent
* Be able to
    * write an expression for the conservation of catalyst, catalytic sites or charge
    * eliminate concentrations of reactive intermediates from mechanistic rate expressions when catalysts, enzymes, or charged species participate in the mechanism
