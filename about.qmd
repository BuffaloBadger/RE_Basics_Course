*Reaction Engineering Basics* is an integrated book and self-study course, comparable to reaction engineering courses in the undergraduate curriculum at many chemical engineering departments in the United States. It is not affiliated with any institution of higher learning, and you cannot earn college credit or any type of certification by completing it. It was created and is maintained by Dr. Carl R. F. Lund because he knew that there were innumerable individuals who wanted to learn about reaction engineering simply for the joy that knowledge would bring.

Carl Lund is a Professor in the [Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/chemical-biological.html) at the [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/). He earned a B. S. in chemical engineering from [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChE) in 1976 and a Ph. D. in chemical engineering from the [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://engineering.wisc.edu/departments/chemical-biological-engineering) in 1981. He worked in the Exxon Corporate Research Laboratories from 1981 to 1986, after which he joined the faculty at the University at Buffalo. He is a fellow of the AIChE.  He started teaching undergraduate kinetics and reaction engineering in 1986, and has taught it every year since, except for 1998, 1999 and 2000. His current research activity centers on pedagogy for problem-solving courses.

I could use any number of clichés here, but instead I'll just say that my wife, Deb, has been unbelievably supportive of me in my career, and particularly as I wrote this book. I owe her a debt that I can't hope to repay, but at the very least, I can thank and acknowledge her for all she has done and continues to do. So thanks, Deb, you're the best!

I was fortunate and blessed to receive a fantastic formal eduction. From grade school through graduate school I've been taught by many outstanding educators, and I thank them all. Two in particular stand out. Jim Dumesic, "the Boss," is one. When he became my PhD advisor, I expected it to be a 4 to 5 year deal. It wasn't. Jim has been my mentor, trusted advisor and true friend ever since that day. For over forty years, he's always been there for me, and I can't thank him enough. The other standout is Phil Wankat. Without going into the details, I was ready to change majors after my first undergraduate chemical engineering course. It didn't happen because Phil Wankat taught the second chemical engineering course I took, one on stagewise separations. He is the best teacher I ever had, and his teaching and personality are directly responsible for me being a chemical engineer today. 

The [University at Buffalo](https://www.buffalo.edu/), its [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://engineering.buffalo.edu) and its [Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/chemical-biological.html) have been my professional home since 1986. They have provided an environment that is equally supportive of educational innovation and, in my case, catalysis and reaction engineering research. I appreciate that educational innovation is not only supported, it is recognized and rewarded.

Personally, I believe there is a God who blessed me with the ability, circumstances and perseverence to write this book.
