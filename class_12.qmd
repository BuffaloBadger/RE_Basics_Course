## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 12 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for initial-value, ordinary differential equations (IVODEs) and derivative expression
* Understand
    * how a numerical IVODE solver works and how to use one
    * when multiple steady states are possible, the procedure used to start a CSTR up determines which steady state it reaches
* Be able to
    * determine whether a reaction engineering assignment involves a steady-state CSTR or a transient CSTR
    * solve a set of IVODEs numerically
