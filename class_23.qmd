## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 3 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for bulk fluid, porous solid, boundary layer, porosity, tortuosity, Thiele modulus, and effectiveness factor
* Understand when two phases are present in a packed bed reactor, temperature and concentration gradients exist between the bulk fluid and the surface and within the solid packing if it is porous
* Be able to use the effectiveness factor to account for temperature and concentration gradients when modeling a packed bed PFR
