## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 37 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for dispersion coefficient
* Understand
    * under most circumstances, predictions using the axial dispersion model are negligibly different from predictions using the ideal PFR model
    * when the dispersion coefficients are treated as fitting parameters, the axial dispersion model can be used to model reactors that are neither ideal PFRs nor CSTRs
    * when the dispersion coefficients are very large, the axial dispersion model predictions approach those of the ideal CSTR model
    * when the dispersion coefficients are very small, the axial dispersion model predictions approach those of the ideal PFR model
* Be able to
    * calculate the output molar flow rates and temperature from a given reactor using an axial dispersion reactor model
