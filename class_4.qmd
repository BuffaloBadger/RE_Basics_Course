## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 4 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for reaction mechanism, mechanistic rate expression, reactive intermediate, Bodenstein steady-state approximation, and apparent rate coefficient
* Understand
    * mechanistic steps are elementary reactions
* Be able to
    * write an expression for the rate of generation of a reactant or product of a non-elementary reaction in terms of its rates of generation in the steps of the reaction’s mechanism
    * simplify rate expressions for kinetically insignificant and effectively irreversible steps
    * identify reactive intermediates
    * write Bodenstein steady-state approximation for a reactive intermediate
    * eliminate concentrations of reactive intermediates from mechanistic rate expressions using the Bodenstein steady-state approximation
    * define the minimum number of apparent rate coefficients in a mechanistic rate expression
