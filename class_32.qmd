## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 32 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for recycle PFR and recycle ratio
* Understand
    * the reactor inlet molar flow rates and temperature should always be among the variables found by numerically solving the mixing point balance equations for a recycle PFR
    * when the reactor inlet molar flow rates and temperature are among the variables found by numerically solving the mixing point balance equations for a recycle PFR, the PFR design equations can be solved within the mixing point residuals function if necessary
