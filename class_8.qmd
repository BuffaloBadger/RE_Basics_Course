## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 8 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for steady-state/transient/isothermal/adiabatic/non-isothermal/isobaric/isochoric reactor operation, sensible/latent heat, and specification/optimization/design/parameter estimation tasks
* Understand
    * the CSTR model assumptions
    * the workflow used for completing reaction engineering assignments in REB
* Be able to
    * qualitatively describe how the reaction rate, composition, temperature, and related quantities evolve with space time, given appropriate information about rate expressions and reaction exothermicity
    * concisely summarize a reaction engineering assignment
    * select and simplify the mole, energy, and momentum balance equations needed for modeling a given CSTR
    * express sensible heat terms using molar, volumetric, or gravimetric heat capacities
