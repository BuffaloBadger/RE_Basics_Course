## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 3 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for reaction rate, species generation rate, net rate, forward rate, reverse rate, empirical/theoretical/mechanistic rate expression, Arrhenius expression, pre-exponential factor, activation energy, typical/auto-catalytic/product-inhibited/reactant-inhibited reactions
* Understand
    * the functional form of rate expressions is only known a priori for elementary reactions
    * rate expressions must be experimentally validated
* Be able to
    * convert reaction rates to species generation rates and vice versa
    * write a power-law rate expression
    * modify a rate expression so that the rate it predicts goes to zero as equilibrium is approached
    * estimate Arrhenius expression parameters using experimental data
    * test whether a quantity displays Arrhenius temperature dependence given either data or an expression for its dependence on temperature
