## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 3 you should...

* Understand
    * the SBSTR model assumptions
    * when a gas reacts in an SBSTR, the differential form of the ideal gas law may need to be added to the design equations
    * the rate at which heat is released in an SBSTR can be controlled using the inlet flow rate
* Be able to select and simplify the mole and energy balance equations needed for modeling a given SBSTR
