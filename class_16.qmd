## Learning Outcomes {.ch}

After completing Class 16 you should...

* Know the definition/defining equation for net rate
* Understand
    * BSTR operation may involve a protocol where operating variables are changed at specified times
    * each change in an operating variable defines the end of one stage and the beginning of the next
    * the values of BSTR variables at the end of one stage are used as the initial values for the next stage
* Be able to calculate the net rate of BSTR production numerically
